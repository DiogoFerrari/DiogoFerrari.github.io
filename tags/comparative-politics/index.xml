&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/img/public-opinion-6-may68.jpg&#34; align=&#34;left&#34; style=&#34;padding-right: 10px;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; &gt; In democratic, multicultural, and pluralistic modern societies in which a variety of political views coexist and are freely expressed in social media, news, and party discourses, people can feel that their world view and lifestyle are threatened by political opinions that are different from theirs. Hence, even political activism in favor of equality and inclusion can lead to reaction and counter-reactions that increase political tension among the public. Increasing tension can lead to radicalization, extremism in political attitudes, passionate partidarism, and entrenchment of groups in different poles of the political position and ideological spectrum. The emergence of neo-nationalism and “welfare chauvinism” are examples of such tendencies. Under what conditions opinions tend to polarize, and in which dimensions? This project studies the polarization of public opinion from three different perspectives: causes, consequences, and theory of measurement of polarization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found in my research on the polarization of public opinion in OECD countries that the dimensions of polarization vary substantially between countries. In the USA, there is a steady increase in partisan polarization (identification as Democrat or Republican and feelings of anger against opposite groups) of the public and a decrease in polarization on policy preferences (e.g., support for welfare policies). In other countries, the opposite happens. I have found that protest and political activism is higher when both types of polarization coincide, and when parties do not vocalize the social divisions. In those cases, political activism emerges because public opinion polarization led some groups to feel threatened and they do not find resolution through established institutional means of representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is some current work in progress:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Measuring Polarization of Public Opinion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Latent Polarization in Welfare Attitudes in OECD countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-class Coalition in Public Support for Welfare Policies in OECD countries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
