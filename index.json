As sessões semanais da disciplina estão divididas em aulas expositivas e seminários.\nOs seminários são organizados em torno de debates específicos: textos com visões e explicações alternativas para o mesmo fenômeno. Na semana seguinte à realização do seminário, os alunos devem entregar um pequeno trabalho (não mais que três páginas impressas com as especificações usuais – espaço 2, letra tamanho 12, etc.). O trabalho deve trazer uma resenha crítica do debate. Serão cinco resenhas ao longo do curso.\nA nota final será composta pelas notas das resenhas e de duas provas a serem realizadas em classe. As provas serão individuais e sem consulta a livros ou anotações. Cada resenha trabalho vale 10% da nota final e cada prova 25%. Haverá monitores para acompanhamento e apoio às atividades desenvolvidas no curso. Em caso de impossibilidade de realização da primeira prova, o aluno deverá apresentar requerimento à secretaria do DCP justificando sua ausência. O prazo máximo de apresentação deste requerimento é 21 de setembro. Não haverá prova substitutiva ao final do semestre. Terão direito à prova de recuperação apenas os alunos que entregarem ao menos três resenhas e fizerem as duas provas. A nota da recuperação será calculada com base na média da nota da prova aplicada para esta finalidade e a nota final obtida na disciplina.\nPROGRAMA 1ª Semana.

Researchers can never be sure a priori if that assumption is adequate. Recent literature in statistics and political science have proposed models that use Dirichlet process priors to deal with the possibility of latent heterogeneity in the covariate effects. In this paper, we extend and generalize those approaches and propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process of generalized linear models in which the latent heterogeneity can depend on context-level features. Such a model is important in comparative analyses when the data comes from different countries and the latent heterogeneity can be a function of country-level features. We provide a Gibbs sampler for the general model, a special Gibbs sampler for gaussian outcome variables, and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo within Gibbs to handle discrete outcome variables. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for latent heterogeneity with a Monte Carlo exercise and with two applications that replicate recent scholarly work. We show how Simpson’s paradox can emerge in the empirical analysis if latent heterogeneity is ignored and how the proposed model can be used to estimate heterogeneity in the effect of covariates.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Context-dependent Latent Effect Heterogeneity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari","Walter R.

Latent heterogeneity can occur because latent conditioning terms (i.e., interactive factors) are omitted in the empirical analysis.\nIn generalized linear models, omitting interactions can lead to latent occurrences Simpson's Paradox, which is a long-standing problem in statistical analysis in general and in the social sciences in particular. Simpson's paradox refers to the possibility that an effect found when data are aggregated is entirely different or even reversed when data are separated and analyzed in groups. If these groups are latent, classical empirical approaches (GLM, mixed models, etc.) are not able to detect and deal with them, meaning that Simpson's Paradox goes unnoticed by the researcher. In practice, it means that a researcher can conclude that an effect is positive when, in fact, it is positive only for a subgroup of the population but negative for another subgroup.\nIn comparative analysis, there is another level of complication: different countries can have different latent factors conditioning different observed covariates. This problem is not new, and many researchers have recognized its importance and its implications for both observational and experimental studies (see, for instance, Adam Przeworski, 2007). It is impossible for researchers to know a priori if interactions are omitted. Suzan Stokes (2014), using different terms, argues that the omnipresent possibility of omitting relevant interactions in the analysis is a source of an attitude of radical skepticism regarding the results of observational and experimental empirical investigation in the social sciences. She says:\n But from the standpoint of the radical skeptic, no research design can dispose of all potential interactions. Setting plausibility aside, if units have high dimensionality and if some confounders are unmeasurable, some unobserved trait is always likely to interact with the treatment. Faced with an experimental study that uncovers a causal effect, the radical skeptic should posit some unspecified subset of units whose response to treatment is at odds with the average response, potentially changing the theoretical implications of the study’s findings. If interactions can change the interpretation of experimental results, then the radical skeptic should be unnerved by their implication for experimental research. Because one can test only for interactions between treatments and observed factors, ungrounded skepticism implies that we will remain in the dark regarding the real findings of experimental studies. Unobserved interactions [...] are omnipresent and inevitably limit the contribution of research to knowledge (Stokes, 2014, pg. 46)  This project develops some machine learning approaches and semi-parametric Bayesian (SPB) methods for dealing with those issues and investigating if interactions were omitted.\nA recent a recent paper, \u0026ldquo;Modeling Context-Dependent Latent Effect Heterogeneity,\u0026rdquo; published in Political Analysis, I propose a hierarchical Dirichlet mixture of generalized linear models to deal with that problem. Using the model, researchers don’t need to specify all interactions explicitly. The model estimates marginal effects, even though interactions are missing in the model specification. Moreover, contrary to previous approaches, my method allows researchers to investigate whether contextual features such as schools, hospitals, neighborhoods, and country-specific institutional settings are associated with the emergence of latent heterogeneity in the effect of observables. I illustrate the model’s contributions with applications in political science that investigate attitudes toward financial aid and the effect of inequality on beliefs about meritocracy. The method is implemented in R, and it is available in the R package Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Generalized Linear Models (hdpGLM).\nI have used SPB models to study the latent structure of public support for welfare policies in OECD countries. I show that there is a hidden polarization among the observed socioeconomic groups in some countries but not others. My research indicates that one side effect of welfare policies in highly unequal societies with fragmented party systems is the existence of latent polarization in welfare policy preferences among individuals with similar observed socioeconomic characteristics. Countries that do not display such a latent polarization (the USA, Japan, Australia, New Zealand) usually have comparative smaller welfare states.\nHere are some related papers:\n  (2019) Modeling Context-Dependent Latent Effect Heterogeneity Political Analysis\n  Measuring Public Polarization and its Connection to the Determinants of Political Preferences\n  Identification Analysis and Multimodality of Posterior Distribution in Bayesian Models.\n  References   Przeworski, A., Is the science of comparative politics possible? , In C.

In developed nations, immigration has played a significant role in public attitudes about supra-national integration.\nThis project seeks to understand how information about inequality and income distribution affect political attitudes about welfare policies and political integration. How do different social groups process information about inequality? How does that information change their perception about their social and political environment? How do perceptions affect political attitudes and ideological positions?\nAs a part of this project, I have conducted a nation-wide survey experiment in 2018-2019 in Brazil with other collaborators to investigate the reaction of various groups to different types of information about the distribution of income and inequality. Preliminary results show that people, particularly from the middle class, tend to act as if demand for redistribution led to an increase in welfare state efforts. So, information about the distribution of income make people adjust their belief about the demand for redistribution and, as a consequence, strengthen their support (opposition) to redistributive policies and parties with redistributive programs.\nNot only that. Information about state-level demand for redistribution makes high-income groups more centralist (favor centralization of political authority). Poor population, on the other hand, support more decentralization when they receive the same information. An interesting finding is that the effect of information is stronger among the white population because this population perceive that they and, therefore, other groups as well, can influence political decisions. On the other hand, the attitudes of non-white population, who feel marginalized from the political process, are less affected by information about inequality and demand for welfare policies.\nSome related working papers:\n Public Policy Preferences, Redistribution, and Support for Welfare Integration in Multilevel Polities: a Survey Experiment in Brazil  ","date":1560306464,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560306464,"objectID":"d6cb23c32db0b2a8a7244327bd988a8c","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/research/survey-br/","publishdate":"2019-06-11T23:27:44-03:00","relpermalink":"/research/survey-br/","section":"research","summary":"Using nation-wide surveys and surveys experiments, this project investigates how different social groups process information about inequality and income distribution, how information affect their perceptions, and how those perceptions affect policy preferences.","tags":["Political Behavior"],"title":"Information, Income Distribution, and Policy Preferences","type":"research"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari","Walter Mebane","Kevin McAlister","Patrick Wu"],"categories":["Political Methodology"],"content":" Elections are one of the cornerstones of modern democracies. *Election forensics* is a subarea of Political Science that uses statistical methods to investigate frauds in election.

In the first paper, I propose a hdpGLM to deal with context-dependent latent heterogeneity in the effect of observed covariates. The model is motivated by the problem of investigating how people's socioeconomic characteristics affect their support for redistributive policies. The problem is that (1) many variables that condition the effect of observed socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals are latent or remain unmeasured, and (2) those latent conditioning features vary from country to country. The omitted variables can produce latent heterogeneity in the effect of observed covariates not only across countries but within each country as well. The proposed model allows us to investigate that context-dependent latent heterogeneity. It is general enough to be used with any hierarchical data in which the latent heterogeneity in the effect of lower-level characteristics is a function of upper-level features of the contexts, such as schools, hospitals, countries, or other institutional settings. The paper also shows how the model can be used to investigate the occurrence of Simpson's paradox in the context of generalized linear models. In the second paper, I apply the hdpGLM approach to investigate the latent heterogeneity and polarization in voters' redistributive policy preferences. Previous studies only investigated polarization among observed socioeconomic groups (rich versus poor, white versus non-white), overlooking or ignoring within-group latent polarizations and cross-groups latent coalitions in policy preferences. The major contribution of the paper is a polarization model that uses the hdpGLM approach, accounts for latent heterogeneity in the determinants of redistributive preferences, and demonstrates how that heterogeneity in the effect of observed covariates can lead to different latent structures of polarization in different political contexts. In the third and final paper, I dive into the theoretical question of the association between socioeconomic positions and welfare preferences, which is the topic that motivated the first two methodological papers. The theoretical question I address is: What emphexplains the negative association between socioeconomic positions and welfare policy preferences? That is, what is the mechanism that links socioeconomic positions to welfare policy preferences? The predominant explanation for that association is that people evaluate welfare policies from the point of view of their material self-interest. Looking at their own pocket, low-income groups see welfare policies as benefits for themselves, and high-income groups see that as cost and constraint to their consumption power. Based on political sociology and socially situated cognition literature, this paper questions that mechanism and argues that socioeconomic positions affect redistributive preferences in part because it affects perceptions about the socioeconomic environment and people's cognitive patterns of outcome attribution. Lower classes are more affected by the constraints imposed by external conditions, so they tend to attribute outcomes to exogenous forces rather than to individuals' agency, and they develop a more pessimistic perception about country's economy and unemployment. Those perceptions about the socioeconomic environment, affected by socioeconomic positions, affect redistribution preferences. The empirical analysis is based on a series of structural equations estimated using cross-national data from the European Social.","tags":null,"title":"Essays on the Micro-Foundations of Welfare Attitudes and Polarization of Policy Preferences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari","Kevin McAlister","Walter Mebane"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532131200,"objectID":"0525429d39782366872fddd63d5a28ba","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2018-dimensions/","publishdate":"2018-07-08T21:43:28.401139Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2018-dimensions/","section":"publication","summary":"We present new developments regarding positive empirical models of election frauds.

The framework can be used with a larger class of probability distributions (i.e. parametric and distributional assumptions) than the original model that includes a mixture of restricted normal distributions. The general formulation explicitly models effects of covariates associated with voters’ behavior and with the occurrence of frauds. We present logistic-binomial and restricted Normal variants of the general model. We present an extension intended to handle absentee/mail precincts, where we do not observe how many electors acted in each type of election unit.

(PNAS 2012). Taking a censored-Normal finite mixture likelihood implementation of Klimek et al.’s idea (Mebane, MPSA 2016) as a point of departure, we develop a variation of the model for which we estimate parameters using a Bayesian MCMC algorithm. The variation uses functional forms somewhat more familiar to political scientists than those used in the Klimek conception: e.g., logistic-binomial models for turnout and votes instead of censored Normal distributions. We consider the effect that introducing covariates to condition the means of turnout and of leading party vote share has on the performance and interpretability of the models. We assess the performance of the logistic model using simulated data in Monte Carlo sampling experiments. We apply both the Normal and logistic models to data from presidential elections in Brazil, the United States (California) and Kenya. The logistic model’s performance is promising, except for a problem with inferior multiple posterior modes. In the applications to real data the results from the logistic model are similar to results from the Normal likelihood model.","tags":null,"title":"Positive Empirical Models of Election Frauds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marta Arretche","Rogerio Schlegel","Diogo Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"63d5aba2d45cea40f20e04afcbc05366","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2015-preferences/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.651917Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2015-preferences/","section":"publication","summary":"This article examines individual preferences toward the vertical distribution of authority in Brazil by means of a representative national survey. We propose an original methodology to tackle two challenges the current literature faces: the effects of multipolarity over voters’ preferences and the conflation of two concepts—“wishes for change” and “preferences over the architecture of the state—both concerning attitudes toward the vertical distribution of authority. We test various theories concerning the importance of territorial identity, socio-demographic factors, and geography of income in determining individual preferences regarding vertical distribution of authority. We find that in Brazil territorial identity does not play a role in determining preferences, whereas socioeconomic status and within-regions inequality do matter, suggesting that Brazil is a type of federation where a dual identity (belonging to one’s region and the national state) prevails as well as within- and cross-region inequality.","tags":null,"title":"Preferences Regarding the Vertical Distribution of Authority in Brazil: On Measurement and Determinants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari","Marta Arretche","Rogerio Schlegel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"b11af87c400db571020e956dbbe8e520","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2016-centralization/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.663661Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2016-centralization/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The Conditional Direct and Unconditional Indirect Effect of Income on Preferences for Centralization of Authority","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"85c733eb2b372cc20bdfc74194285fed","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2015-effect/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.665168Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2015-effect/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Effect of Intraparty Negotiation on Interregional Redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marta Arretche","Rogerio Schlegel","Diogo Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"5274877f3920b6a9f51c441d731f56ed","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2014-territorial/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.665598Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2014-territorial/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The Territorial Division of Power: A Survey on Brazil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Augusto Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"3dc4f051a9fdef47ae76226ee51f8442","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2013-m-athesis/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.652979Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2013-m-athesis/","section":"publication","summary":"This work explains the choices regarding the fiscal institutions approved during the Brazilian Constitutional Convention of 1988. The new Brazilian Constitution augmented the distribution of public resources across states through intergovernmental transfers, mitigating state-level regional inequalities, but did not impose any loss of revenue to rich states. The interplay between the party structure, the electoral institutions, the Convention decision-making rules, and the regional inequalities explains that outcome. First, representatives from poor states with low fiscal capacity formed a coalition. They demanded more regional redistribution through constitutional transfers. Second, that coalition was favored by the majoritarian rule of the Constitutional Convention. Third, representatives in the Constitutional Convention were all members of national parties. At the same, time they voted in favor of the interest of their states, they defended the interest of their parties. Legislative representatives are elected at the state-level elections. If the members of the poor-states coalition had chosen a different fiscal design and this design had caused loss of revenue to the states of the rich-states minority coalition, such a decision could have caused electoral losses for some parties that have members at both poor- and rich-states coalitions. For this reason, they augmented the regional redistribution but did not impose any loss of revenue for rich states.","tags":null,"title":"Fiscal Decentralization and Redistribution of Public Revenue: FPE in the Brazilian Constitutional Convention of 1988","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Augusto Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"f0da204f54c1a442c2455e1144b37a5f","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2011-tratadosen/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.653652Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2011-tratadosen/","section":"publication","summary":"Conventional wisdom among scholars and news media states that Congress is a minor player in the negotiation of international treaties because it lacks power and due to informational barriers.

Diversity, Inclusion, and Disability Statement   This course is open to all students who meet the academic requirements for participation. Any student who has a documented need for accommodation should contact Student Disability Services (773-702-6000 or disabilities@uchicago.edu) and the instructor as soon as possible.  It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students\u0026#39; learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength, and benefit. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated.  It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. I will attempt to foster an environment in which each class member is able to hear and respect one another. It is my intent to maintain an atmosphere of trust and safety in the classroom. Please let me know if something said or done in the classroom, by either myself or other students, is particularly troubling or causes discomfort or offense. While our intention may not be to cause discomfort or offense, the impact of what happens throughout the course is not to be ignored and is something that I consider to be very important and deserving of attention. If and when this occurs, there are several ways to alleviate some of the discomfort or hurt you may experience:    Discuss the situation privately with me. I am always open to listening to students\u0026#39; experiences and want to work with students to find acceptable ways to process and address the issue.    Discuss the situation with the class. Chances are there is at least one other student in the class who had a similar response to the material. Discussion enhances the ability for all class participants to have a fuller understanding of context and impact of course material and class discussions.    Notify me of the issue through another source such as your preceptor, a trusted faculty member, or a peer. If for any reason you do not feel comfortable discussing the issue directly with me, I encourage you to contact your preceptor and/or your program\u0026#39;s Diversity and Inclusion representative: Darcy Heuring (MAPSS), Matthias Staisch (CIR), and Chad Cyrenne (Computation). You are also welcome and encouraged to contact the Faculty Director of your program.    The University of Chicago is committed to diversity and rigorous inquiry from multiple perspectives. The MAPSS, CIR, and Computation programs share this commitment and seek to foster productive learning environments based upon inclusion, open communication, and mutual respect for a diverse range of identities, experiences, and positions. Any suggestions for how we might further such objectives both in and outside the classroom are appreciated and will be given serious consideration. Please share your suggestions or concerns with your instructor, your preceptor, or your program’s Diversity and Inclusion representatives: Darcy Heuring (MAPSS), Matthias Staisch (CIR), and Chad Cyrenne (Computation). You are also welcome and encouraged to contact the Faculty Director of your program. Academic Integrity   The University of Chicago has a formal policy on academic honesty that you are expected to adhere to. Here are some guidelines we expect you to follow:    Courtesy, honesty, and respect should be shown by students toward faculty members, guest lecturers, administrative support staff, and fellow students. Similarly, students should expect faculty to treat them fairly, showing respect for their ideas and opinions and striving to help them achieve maximum benefits from their experience in the School.    Academic dishonesty can encompass many activities, which includes plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, falsification of records or official documents, intentional misuse of equipment or materials (including library materials), and aiding and abetting the perpetration of such acts. One of the gravest academic dishonesty is plagiarism: knowingly handing in someone else\u0026#39;s work as your own, whether it be work done by another student in the class or available publicly on the Internet. This class has a zero tolerance policy for plagiarism.    The preparation of solutions for problem sets, papers, and examinations, assigned on an individual basis, must represent each students own effort. Therefore:    You MUST NOT copy or use someone else\u0026#39;s work (with or without their permission) in your own solution. You have to write your own.    DO NOT post your solutions to problem sets or exams in publicly-accessible websites, like pastebin, a public GitHub repository, GitHub gists, etc. While these tools may seem like convenient mechanisms for sharing code with an instructor/TA or with a project partner, they can also expose your code to other students in the class. If you do post your solution in a publicly-accessible location, and we find out about it outside of a plagiarism incident, you will just get a warning. However, if another student in the class uses code that you posted on such a site (even if you did not intend for that code to be used by someone else), you be considered an equally guilty party in a plagiarism offense, and will receive the exact same penalty as the student who used your code.      \\pagebreak Scheduled readings  Lecture 1: Introduction  Suggested  bibentry:fienberg2006did  Lecture 2: Motivation for Bayesian Statistics  Required  bibentry:gill2014bayesian  Ch 2.1: Purpose  Ch 2.3: The Basic Bayesian Framework (only subsection 2.3.1)  Ch 2.4: Bayesian \u0026#34;Learning\u0026#34;  Ch 2.6: Bayesian versus Non-Bayesian Approaches  Lecture 3: Prior Distribution: Preliminaries  Required  bibentry:gill2014bayesian  Ch 2.5: Comments on Prior Distributions  Ch 4.1: A Prior Discussion of Priors  Suggested  bibentry:wasserman-2006-frequestist  Lecture 4, 5: Prior Distribution (conjugate priors)  Required  bibentry:gill2014bayesian  ch 4.3: Conjugate Priors (subsections 4.3.1-4.3.3)  Lecture 6, 7: Prior Distribution  Required  bibentry:gill2014bayesian  Ch 4.3.3: Limitations of Conjugacy  Ch 4.4.2: Jeffreys Prior (all subsections)  Lecture 8, 9: Sensitivity Analysis  Required  bibentry:gill2014bayesian  Ch 6.2.1 Global Sensitivity Analysis  Ch 6.2.2 Local Sensitivity Analysis  Ch 6.2.3 Global and Local Sensitivity Analysis with Recidivism Data  Lecture 10: MC methods  Required  bibentry:gill2014bayesian  Ch 9.1 Background  Ch 9.2 Basic Monte Carlo Integration  Suggested  bibentry:robert2011short  Lecture 11: MC indirect sampling  Required  bibentry:gill2014bayesian  Ch 9.3 Rejection Sampling  Lecture 12-13: MC ARS, IS, wrap-up  Required  TBA  Lecture 14: MCMC Intuition  Required  bibentry:robert2011short  Lecture 15: MCMC (DBC)  Required  bibentry:chib1995understanding  Suggested  bibentry:metropolis1953equation  bibentry:hastings1970monte  bibentry:geman1984stochastic  bibentry:gelfand1990sampling  Lecture 16: MCMC (Foundations)  Suggested  bibentry:mengersen1996rates  Lecture 17-23: MCMC (HW, Gibbs, Implementation)  Required  TBA  Lecture 24: Summaries of the Posterior  Required  bibentry:gill2014bayesian  Ch 2.3.2 Summarizing Posterior Distributions with Intervals  Ch 2.3.3 Quantile Posterior Summaries  Lecture 25: Model Choice  Required  TBA  Lecture 26: No class - Thanksgiving  Lecture 27: Hierarchical Bayesian Models  Required  bibentry:gill2014bayesian  Ch 12.5 Essential Structure of the Bayesian Hierarchical Model  Ch 12.6 The General Role of Priors and Hyperpriors  Lecture 28: Wrap-up  Lecture 29: No class - Reading Period  References\u0026#xa0;\u0026#xa0;\u0026#xa0;ignore   \\pagebreak bibliographystyle:apalike bibliography:~/Dropbox/CienciasSociais/references/references.bib ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5efee0a5b2f0096317ffadcbff9f42b9","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/teaching/2019-fall-uchicago-intro-bayesian/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/2019-fall-uchicago-intro-bayesian/syllabus/","section":"teaching","summary":"MACS 30301 - Introduction to Bayesian Statistics\u0026#xa0;\u0026#xa0;\u0026#xa0;ignore  -------------------------------------------------- \\begin{center} \\textbf{\\Large MACS 30301 - Introduction to Bayesian Statistics} Computational Social Science Division of the Social Sciences University of Chicago Autumn/2019 \\end{center} --------------------------------------------------  Course information     Instructor: Diogo Ferrari   e-mail: diogoferrari@uchicago.edu   Office: 5730 S.
