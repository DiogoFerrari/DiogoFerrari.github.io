As sessões semanais da disciplina estão divididas em aulas expositivas e seminários.\nOs seminários são organizados em torno de debates específicos: textos com visões e explicações alternativas para o mesmo fenômeno. Na semana seguinte à realização do seminário, os alunos devem entregar um pequeno trabalho (não mais que três páginas impressas com as especificações usuais – espaço 2, letra tamanho 12, etc.). O trabalho deve trazer uma resenha crítica do debate. Serão cinco resenhas ao longo do curso.\nA nota final será composta pelas notas das resenhas e de duas provas a serem realizadas em classe. As provas serão individuais e sem consulta a livros ou anotações. Cada resenha trabalho vale 10% da nota final e cada prova 25%. Haverá monitores para acompanhamento e apoio às atividades desenvolvidas no curso. Em caso de impossibilidade de realização da primeira prova, o aluno deverá apresentar requerimento à secretaria do DCP justificando sua ausência. O prazo máximo de apresentação deste requerimento é 21 de setembro. Não haverá prova substitutiva ao final do semestre. Terão direito à prova de recuperação apenas os alunos que entregarem ao menos três resenhas e fizerem as duas provas. A nota da recuperação será calculada com base na média da nota da prova aplicada para esta finalidade e a nota final obtida na disciplina.\nPROGRAMA 1ª Semana.

Latent heterogeneity can occur because latent conditioning terms (i.e., interactive factors) are omitted in the empirical analysis.\nIn generalized linear models, omitting interactions can lead to latent occurrences Simpson\u0026rsquo;s Paradox, which is a long-standing problem in statistical analysis in general and in the social sciences in particular. Simpson\u0026rsquo;s paradox refers to the possibility that an effect found when data are aggregated is entirely different or even reversed when data are separated and analyzed in groups. If these groups are latent, classical empirical approaches (GLM, mixed models, etc.) are not able to detect and deal with them, meaning that Simpson\u0026rsquo;s Paradox goes unnoticed by the researcher. In practice, it means that a researcher can conclude that an effect is mildly positibe when, in fact, it is strongly positive for part of the population but negative for another part.\nIn comparative analysis, there is another level of complication: different countries can have different latent factors conditioning different observed covariates. This problem is not new, and many researchers have recognized its importance and its implications for both observational and experimental studies (see, for instance, Adam Przeworski, 2007). It is impossible for researchers to know a priori if interactions are omitted. Suzan Stokes (2014), using different terms, argues that the omnipresent possibility of omitting relevant interactions in the analysis is a source of an attitude of radical skepticism regarding the results of observational and experimental empirical investigation in the social sciences. She says:\n But from the standpoint of the radical skeptic, no research design can dispose of all potential interactions. Setting plausibility aside, if units have high dimensionality and if some confounders are unmeasurable, some unobserved trait is always likely to interact with the treatment. Faced with an experimental study that uncovers a causal effect, the radical skeptic should posit some unspecified subset of units whose response to treatment is at odds with the average response, potentially changing the theoretical implications of the study’s findings. If interactions can change the interpretation of experimental results, then the radical skeptic should be unnerved by their implication for experimental research. Because one can test only for interactions between treatments and observed factors, ungrounded skepticism implies that we will remain in the dark regarding the real findings of experimental studies. Unobserved interactions [...] are omnipresent and inevitably limit the contribution of research to knowledge (Stokes, 2014, pg. 46)  This project develops some machine learning approaches and semi-parametric Bayesian (SPB) methods for dealing with those issues and investigating if interactions were omitted.\nA recent a recent paper, \u0026ldquo;Modeling Context-Dependent Latent Effect Heterogeneity,\u0026rdquo; published a Political Analysis, I propose a hierarchical Dirichlet mixture of generalized linear models to deal with that problem in comparative analysis. Using the model, researchers don’t need to specify all interactions explicitly. The model estimates marginal effects, even though interactions are missing in the model specification. Moreover, on the contrary to previous approaches, my method allows researchers to investigate whether the \u0026ldquo;context\u0026rdquo; such as schools, hospitals, neighborhoods, and country-specific institutional settings and its features are associated with the emergence of latent heterogeneity in the effect of observables. I illustrate the model’s contributions with applications in political science that investigate attitudes toward financial help to other countries and the effect of inequality on beliefs about meritocracy. The method is implemented in R, and it is available in the R package Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Generalized Linear Models (hdpGLM).\nI have used SPB models to study the latent structure of public support for welfare policies in OECD countries. I show that there is a hidden polarization among the observed socioeconomic groups in some countries but not others. My research indicates that one side effect of welfare policies in highly unequal societies with fragmented party systems is the existence of latent polarization in welfare policy preferences among individuals with similar observed socioeconomic characteristics. Countries that do not display such a latent polarization (the USA, Japan, Australia, New Zealand) usually have comparative smaller welfare states.\nHere is some related papers:\n (2019) Modeling Context-Dependent Latent Effect Heterogeneity Political Analysis\n Measuring Public Polarization and its Connection to the Determinants of Political Preferences\n Identification Analysis and Multimodality of Posterior Distribution in Bayesian Models.\n  References  Przeworski, A., Is the science of comparative politics possible? , In C.

Increasing tension can lead to radicalization, extremism in political attitudes, passionate partisanship, and entrenchment of groups in different poles of the political and ideological spectrum. This project investigates those trends from two perspectives.\nFirst, the project investigates how individuals\u0026rsquo; material conditions are connected to their perceptions about the socioeconomic environment, including the state of the economy, unemployment, and other social groups, and how those perceptions are connected, by its turn, to political preferences.\nSecond, political leaders can take advantage of tensions in voters\u0026rsquo; preferences to gain electoral support. We use unsupervised learning methods to investigate latent subpopulations that are more easily targeted by those politicians.

Researchers can never be sure a priori if that assumption is adequate. Recent literature in statistics and political science have proposed models that use Dirichlet process priors to deal with the possibility of latent heterogeneity in the covariate effects. In this paper, we extend and generalize those approaches and propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process of generalized linear models in which the latent heterogeneity can depend on context-level features. Such a model is important in comparative analyses when the data comes from different countries and the latent heterogeneity can be a function of country-level features. We provide a Gibbs sampler for the general model, a special Gibbs sampler for gaussian outcome variables, and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo within Gibbs to handle discrete outcome variables. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for latent heterogeneity with a Monte Carlo exercise and with two applications that replicate recent scholarly work. We show how Simpson’s paradox can emerge in the empirical analysis if latent heterogeneity is ignored and how the proposed model can be used to estimate heterogeneity in the effect of covariates.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Context-dependent Latent Effect Heterogeneity","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Comparative politics"],"content":"Under construction\nThis project has two main goals. First, we study the effect of information about inequality and income distribution on perceptions and political attitudes. I have conducted a nation-wide survey experiment in Brazil about that topic, and now I want to expand the research to OECD countries. In a survey experiment conducted in Brazil, I found that people tend to act as if the classical Meltzer and Richard mechanism worked in practice. That is, people, particularly from the middle class, tend to believe that demand for redistribution actually leads to an increase in welfare state efforts. So, information about distribution of income make people adjust their believe about demand for redistribution and, as a consequence, strengten they support (opposition) to redistributive policies and parties with redistributive programs. I am preparing a paper with those results for submission. The decision of the UK to leave the EU has demonstrated the relevance of public opinion about integration, as well as the consequences of that decision. Classical theories about public preferences for allocation of political authority in multilevel polities emphasize the role of economic conditions, identity, and nationalist/regionalist values. In the EU, immigration has played a big role on public attitudes. In this project, I evaluate how attitudes about decentralization of political authority are affected by informational shortcuts and perceptions about the economy, inequality, and demand of different groups for welfare policies. In a survey experiment conducted in Brazil, one of the largest federations in the world, I found that people, particularly from the middle class, tend to believe that demand for redistribution actually leads to an increase in welfare state efforts. People act as if the classical Meltzer and Richard mechanism worked. That believe increases the demand for decentralization among the middle and affluent classes if they receive information that there is more demand for redistribution under centralization/integration of social policies. Moreover, perceptions about demand for redistribution affects support for welfare policies, and information about welfare demand alter those preferences. Depending on ideology, high income people who oppose redistribution tend to take more extreme positions when they are informed that demand for welfare is higher than they initially thought.

We consider the effect that introducing covariates to condition the means of turnout and of leading party vote share has on the performance and interpretability of the models. We assess the performance of the logistic model using simulated data in Monte Carlo sampling experiments. We apply both the Normal and logistic models to data from presidential elections in Brazil, the United States (California) and Kenya.

We test various theories concerning the importance of territorial identity, socio-demographic factors, and geography of income in determining individual preferences regarding vertical distribution of authority. We find that in Brazil territorial identity does not play a role in determining preferences, whereas socioeconomic status and within-regions inequality do matter, suggesting that Brazil is a type of federation where a dual identity (belonging to one’s region and the national state) prevails as well as within- and cross-region inequality.","tags":null,"title":"Preferences Regarding the Vertical Distribution of Authority in Brazil: On Measurement and Determinants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari","Marta Arretche","Rogerio Schlegel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"b11af87c400db571020e956dbbe8e520","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2016-centralization/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.663661Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2016-centralization/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The Conditional Direct and Unconditional Indirect Effect of Income on Preferences for Centralization of Authority","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"85c733eb2b372cc20bdfc74194285fed","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2015-effect/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.665168Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2015-effect/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Effect of Intraparty Negotiation on Interregional Redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marta Arretche","Rogerio Schlegel","Diogo Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"5274877f3920b6a9f51c441d731f56ed","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2014-territorial/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.665598Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2014-territorial/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The Territorial Division of Power: A Survey on Brazil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Augusto Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"3dc4f051a9fdef47ae76226ee51f8442","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2013-m-athesis/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.652979Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2013-m-athesis/","section":"publication","summary":"This work explains the choices regarding the fiscal institutions approved during the Brazilian Constitutional Convention of 1988. The new Brazilian Constitution augmented the distribution of public resources across states through intergovernmental transfers, mitigating state-level regional inequalities, but did not impose any loss of revenue to rich states. The interplay between the party structure, the electoral institutions, the Convention decision-making rules, and the regional inequalities explains that outcome. First, representatives from poor states with low fiscal capacity formed a coalition. They demanded more regional redistribution through constitutional transfers. Second, that coalition was favored by the majoritarian rule of the Constitutional Convention. Third, representatives in the Constitutional Convention were all members of national parties. At the same, time they voted in favor of the interest of their states, they defended the interest of their parties. Legislative representatives are elected at the state-level elections. If the members of the poor-states coalition had chosen a different fiscal design and this design had caused loss of revenue to the states of the rich-states minority coalition, such a decision could have caused electoral losses for some parties that have members at both poor- and rich-states coalitions. For this reason, they augmented the regional redistribution but did not impose any loss of revenue for rich states.","tags":null,"title":"Fiscal Decentralization and Redistribution of Public Revenue: FPE in the Constitutional Convention of 1988","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Augusto Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"f0da204f54c1a442c2455e1144b37a5f","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2011-tratadosen/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.653652Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2011-tratadosen/","section":"publication","summary":"Conventional wisdom among scholars and news media states that Congress is a minor player in the negotiation of international treaties because it lacks power and due to informational barriers. This paper demonstrates that formal institutional rules of Brazilian decision-making process give more power to Congress than previously recognized. It shows how the Brazilian Congress worked as a veto-player only when treaties content included sensitive subjects that could threaten the national sovereign. The paper argues that the role of Congress is not restricted due to lack of information or reduced institutional power, but due to the content of the treaties. That institutional power restricts the topics advanced by the Executive during the negotiations.","tags":null,"title":"The Role of Congress on the negotiation of International Treaties Under the Coalition Presidentialism","type":"publication"}]
