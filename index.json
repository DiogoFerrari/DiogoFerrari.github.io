People who support a candidate due to the candidate’s party affiliation or policy position tend to support or oppose populist or anti-populist messages if they learn that the candidate of the party they identify with supports that message.

All three hypotheses connect socioeconomic position and attitudes toward redistribution, but only the material-heuristics and the self-serving reasoning arguments account for why perceptions of the causes of wealth and poverty vary across economic groups and why this variation matters for attitudes toward redistribution.

Researchers can never be sure a priori if that assumption is adequate. Recent literature in statistics and political science have proposed models that use Dirichlet process priors to deal with the possibility of latent heterogeneity in the covariate effects. In this paper, we extend and generalize those approaches and propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process of generalized linear models in which the latent heterogeneity can depend on context-level features. Such a model is important in comparative analyses when the data comes from different countries and the latent heterogeneity can be a function of country-level features. We provide a Gibbs sampler for the general model, a special Gibbs sampler for gaussian outcome variables, and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo within Gibbs to handle discrete outcome variables. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for latent heterogeneity with a Monte Carlo exercise and with two applications that replicate recent scholarly work. We show how Simpson’s paradox can emerge in the empirical analysis if latent heterogeneity is ignored and how the proposed model can be used to estimate heterogeneity in the effect of covariates.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Context-dependent Latent Effect Heterogeneity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari","Walter R.

In the first paper, I propose a hdpGLM to deal with context-dependent latent heterogeneity in the effect of observed covariates. The model is motivated by the problem of investigating how people's socioeconomic characteristics affect their support for redistributive policies. The problem is that (1) many variables that condition the effect of observed socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals are latent or remain unmeasured, and (2) those latent conditioning features vary from country to country. The omitted variables can produce latent heterogeneity in the effect of observed covariates not only across countries but within each country as well. The proposed model allows us to investigate that context-dependent latent heterogeneity. It is general enough to be used with any hierarchical data in which the latent heterogeneity in the effect of lower-level characteristics is a function of upper-level features of the contexts, such as schools, hospitals, countries, or other institutional settings. The paper also shows how the model can be used to investigate the occurrence of Simpson's paradox in the context of generalized linear models. In the second paper, I apply the hdpGLM approach to investigate the latent heterogeneity and polarization in voters' redistributive policy preferences. Previous studies only investigated polarization among observed socioeconomic groups (rich versus poor, white versus non-white), overlooking or ignoring within-group latent polarizations and cross-groups latent coalitions in policy preferences. The major contribution of the paper is a polarization model that uses the hdpGLM approach, accounts for latent heterogeneity in the determinants of redistributive preferences, and demonstrates how that heterogeneity in the effect of observed covariates can lead to different latent structures of polarization in different political contexts. In the third and final paper, I dive into the theoretical question of the association between socioeconomic positions and welfare preferences, which is the topic that motivated the first two methodological papers. The theoretical question I address is: What emphexplains the negative association between socioeconomic positions and welfare policy preferences? That is, what is the mechanism that links socioeconomic positions to welfare policy preferences? The predominant explanation for that association is that people evaluate welfare policies from the point of view of their material self-interest. Looking at their own pocket, low-income groups see welfare policies as benefits for themselves, and high-income groups see that as cost and constraint to their consumption power. Based on political sociology and socially situated cognition literature, this paper questions that mechanism and argues that socioeconomic positions affect redistributive preferences in part because it affects perceptions about the socioeconomic environment and people's cognitive patterns of outcome attribution. Lower classes are more affected by the constraints imposed by external conditions, so they tend to attribute outcomes to exogenous forces rather than to individuals' agency, and they develop a more pessimistic perception about country's economy and unemployment. Those perceptions about the socioeconomic environment, affected by socioeconomic positions, affect redistribution preferences. The empirical analysis is based on a series of structural equations estimated using cross-national data from the European Social.","tags":null,"title":"Essays on the Micro-Foundations of Welfare Attitudes and Polarization of Policy Preferences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari","Kevin McAlister","Walter Mebane"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532131200,"objectID":"0525429d39782366872fddd63d5a28ba","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2018-dimensions/","publishdate":"2018-07-08T21:43:28.401139Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2018-dimensions/","section":"publication","summary":"We present new developments regarding positive empirical models of election frauds.

We consider how to make statistical decisions about the presence of frauds based on loss functions and posterior predictive distributions of fraud magnitudes. We use the decision framework to compare the varying dimension approach to a fixed-dimensional approach in which the probablities of frauds can become small but always remain positive. Among transdimensional MCMC methods we use reversible jump MCMC but also consider nonparametric Bayes and path sampling methods.

We develop a general Bayesian framework using finite mixture models of product distributions to identify the probability and distribution of frauds in elections. The framework is based on transformations of random variables that capture incremental and extreme frauds inspired by the work of Klimek et al (2012). A formulation that closely matches their specifications is a special case. The framework can be used with a larger class of probability distributions (i.e. parametric and distributional assumptions) than the original model that includes a mixture of restricted normal distributions. The general formulation explicitly models effects of covariates associated with voters’ behavior and with the occurrence of frauds. We present logistic-binomial and restricted Normal variants of the general model. We present an extension intended to handle absentee/mail precincts, where we do not observe how many electors acted in each type of election unit. We use simulated data to show that the logistic-binomial model can be estimated well using MCMC methods and that the estimates have good frequentist coverage properties when the model is correctly specified. Estimates are not as good when relevant covariates are ignored.","tags":null,"title":"Developments in Positive Empirical Models of Election Frauds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"5a4b00fd9cbd1354502ef9d8d08deff2","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2017-semi/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.666418Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2017-semi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Semi-parametric Approch to Estimate Latent Heterogeneity with Generalized Linear Mixed Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari","Marta Arretche","Rogerio Schlegel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"af978bef3cd7e0a55e4f4320dde3cd94","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2017-allocation/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.666016Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2017-allocation/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Allocation of Authority and Preferences for Redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari","Marta Arretche","Rogerio Schlegel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"6c6a46ec479d4f90b4580a29485953bc","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2017-distribution/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.66316Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2017-distribution/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Distribution of Income, Redistributive Preferences, and Preferences for Political Institutions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"49f3a39113c230aceccf349686a225cc","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2017-political/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.658405Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2017-political/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Political Economy of intra-party solidarity and interregional redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"9921aa36ee6968ec3ef6b7801f387645","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2017-centralization/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.666856Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2017-centralization/","section":"publication","summary":"Authors have argued that decentralization of political authority in multilevel polities can have a variety of consequences on policy outcomes. In this paper we investigate how voters make sense of those consequences and how it affects their preference for decentralization in different policy areas. We argue that voters use the aggregate income profile of their fellow voters as a clue to anticipate policy consequences of decentralization. Rich (poor) individuals tend do support centralization when the combination of the proportion of poor population and the average income available for taxation can produce less (more) electoral pressure for redistribution at the national level. We show support for that argument using a survey conducted in Brazil, which contains questions about preferences for allocation of policy authority in many policy areas.","tags":null,"title":"The Mediation Effect of Preferences for Redistribution on Preferences for Centralization of Political Authority by Policy Area","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"ba205824aabc57d5576c9649d2ff6ae8","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2016-binomial/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.661653Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2016-binomial/","section":"publication","summary":"This work presents a Bayesian finite mixture model of logistic regression models to estimate the probability of fraud in elections. The features of the electorate and polling places are built into the structure of the model, which allows researchers to estimate of voters' support for the winning party using election data even if fraud had occurred. Simultaneously, the model estimates fraud probabilities. The inclusion of the voters' covariates eliminates, under certain conditions, misleading estimates of fraud probabilities due to the spatial concentration of votes with similar characteristics. The model is implemented in a Bayesian fashion, and MCMC samples are used for inference. A Monte Carlo exercise is provided to evaluate the model properties. I use the model to estimate fraud probabilities in the second round of the 2010 presidential election in Brazil. To obtain voters covariates, I adopt geostatistic models to combine census data, geolocation of pooling places, and ballot box-level election data.","tags":null,"title":"A Logistic-Binomial Mixture Model for Fraud Detection in Elections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari","Walter R.

(PNAS 2012). Taking a censored-Normal finite mixture likelihood implementation of Klimek et al.’s idea (Mebane, MPSA 2016) as a point of departure, we develop a variation of the model for which we estimate parameters using a Bayesian MCMC algorithm. The variation uses functional forms somewhat more familiar to political scientists than those used in the Klimek conception: e.g., logistic-binomial models for turnout and votes instead of censored Normal distributions. We consider the effect that introducing covariates to condition the means of turnout and of leading party vote share has on the performance and interpretability of the models. We assess the performance of the logistic model using simulated data in Monte Carlo sampling experiments. We apply both the Normal and logistic models to data from presidential elections in Brazil, the United States (California) and Kenya. The logistic model’s performance is promising, except for a problem with inferior multiple posterior modes. In the applications to real data the results from the logistic model are similar to results from the Normal likelihood model.","tags":null,"title":"Positive Empirical Models of Election Frauds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arretche, M.","Schlegel, R.","Ferrari, D."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"63d5aba2d45cea40f20e04afcbc05366","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2015-preferences/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.651917Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2015-preferences/","section":"publication","summary":"This article examines individual preferences toward the vertical distribution of authority in Brazil by means of a representative national survey. We propose an original methodology to tackle two challenges the current literature faces: the effects of multipolarity over voters’ preferences and the conflation of two concepts—“wishes for change” and “preferences over the architecture of the state—both concerning attitudes toward the vertical distribution of authority. We test various theories concerning the importance of territorial identity, socio-demographic factors, and geography of income in determining individual preferences regarding vertical distribution of authority. We find that in Brazil territorial identity does not play a role in determining preferences, whereas socioeconomic status and within-regions inequality do matter, suggesting that Brazil is a type of federation where a dual identity (belonging to one’s region and the national state) prevails as well as within- and cross-region inequality.","tags":null,"title":"Preferences Regarding the Vertical Distribution of Authority in Brazil: On Measurement and Determinants","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari","Marta Arretche","Rogerio Schlegel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"b11af87c400db571020e956dbbe8e520","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2016-centralization/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.663661Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2016-centralization/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The Conditional Direct and Unconditional Indirect Effect of Income on Preferences for Centralization of Authority","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"85c733eb2b372cc20bdfc74194285fed","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2015-effect/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.665168Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2015-effect/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Effect of Intraparty Negotiation on Interregional Redistribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marta Arretche","Rogerio Schlegel","Diogo Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"5274877f3920b6a9f51c441d731f56ed","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2014-territorial/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.665598Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2014-territorial/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The Territorial Division of Power: A Survey on Brazil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Augusto Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"3dc4f051a9fdef47ae76226ee51f8442","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2013-m-athesis/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.652979Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2013-m-athesis/","section":"publication","summary":"This work explains the choices regarding the fiscal institutions approved during the Brazilian Constitutional Convention of 1988. The new Brazilian Constitution augmented the distribution of public resources across states through intergovernmental transfers, mitigating state-level regional inequalities, but did not impose any loss of revenue to rich states. The interplay between the party structure, the electoral institutions, the Convention decision-making rules, and the regional inequalities explains that outcome. First, representatives from poor states with low fiscal capacity formed a coalition. They demanded more regional redistribution through constitutional transfers. Second, that coalition was favored by the majoritarian rule of the Constitutional Convention. Third, representatives in the Constitutional Convention were all members of national parties. At the same, time they voted in favor of the interest of their states, they defended the interest of their parties. Legislative representatives are elected at the state-level elections. If the members of the poor-states coalition had chosen a different fiscal design and this design had caused loss of revenue to the states of the rich-states minority coalition, such a decision could have caused electoral losses for some parties that have members at both poor- and rich-states coalitions. For this reason, they augmented the regional redistribution but did not impose any loss of revenue for rich states.","tags":null,"title":"Fiscal Decentralization and Redistribution of Public Revenue: FPE in the Brazilian Constitutional Convention of 1988","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Augusto Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"f0da204f54c1a442c2455e1144b37a5f","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2011-tratadosen/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.653652Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2011-tratadosen/","section":"publication","summary":"Conventional wisdom among scholars and news media states that Congress is a minor player in the negotiation of international treaties because it lacks power and due to informational barriers.
