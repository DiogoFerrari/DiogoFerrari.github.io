All three hypotheses connect socioeconomic position and attitudes toward redistribution, but only the material-heuristics and the self-serving reasoning arguments account for why perceptions of the causes of wealth and poverty vary across economic groups and why this variation matters for attitudes toward redistribution.

Researchers can never be sure a priori if that assumption is adequate. Recent literature in statistics and political science have proposed models that use Dirichlet process priors to deal with the possibility of latent heterogeneity in the covariate effects. In this paper, we extend and generalize those approaches and propose a hierarchical Dirichlet process of generalized linear models in which the latent heterogeneity can depend on context-level features. Such a model is important in comparative analyses when the data comes from different countries and the latent heterogeneity can be a function of country-level features. We provide a Gibbs sampler for the general model, a special Gibbs sampler for gaussian outcome variables, and a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo within Gibbs to handle discrete outcome variables. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for latent heterogeneity with a Monte Carlo exercise and with two applications that replicate recent scholarly work. We show how Simpson’s paradox can emerge in the empirical analysis if latent heterogeneity is ignored and how the proposed model can be used to estimate heterogeneity in the effect of covariates.","tags":null,"title":"Modeling Context-dependent Latent Effect Heterogeneity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576117808,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576117808,"objectID":"3ecdbf04cb0f8a43f2d5c9b8ec53cfa4","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2019-hdphlm/","publishdate":"2019-12-12T02:30:08.340286Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2019-hdphlm/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents the R package hdpGLM, which contains an implementation of the hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture of Generalized Linear Models (hdpGLM) proposed in Ferrari (2020), expanding non-parametric Bayesian models proposed in Hannah (2011), Mukhopadhyay and Gelfand, (1997) and  Heckman and Vytlacil (2007) to deal with context-dependent cases.

Lower classes are more affected by the constraints imposed by external conditions, so they tend to attribute outcomes to exogenous forces rather than to individuals' agency, and they develop a more pessimistic perception about country's economy and unemployment. Members of high-income groups tend to develop opposite perceptions about the socioeconomic environment and display voluntarist cognitive patterns of outcome attribution (tendency to perceive that agency, effort, and hard work play a major role on individuals' fate).

Latent heterogeneity can occur because latent conditioning terms (i.e., interactive factors) are omitted in the empirical analysis.\nIn generalized linear models, omitting interactions can lead to latent occurrences Simpson\u0026rsquo;s Paradox, which is a long-standing problem in statistical analysis in general and in the social sciences in particular. Simpson\u0026rsquo;s paradox refers to the possibility that an effect found when data are aggregated is entirely different or even reversed when data are separated and analyzed in groups. If these groups are latent, classical empirical approaches (GLM, mixed models, etc.) are not able to detect and deal with them, meaning that Simpson\u0026rsquo;s Paradox goes unnoticed by the researcher. In practice, it means that a researcher can conclude that an effect is positive when, in fact, it is positive only for a subgroup of the population but negative for another subgroup.\nIn comparative analysis, there is another level of complication: different countries can have different latent factors conditioning different observed covariates. This problem is not new, and many researchers have recognized its importance and its implications for both observational and experimental studies (see, for instance, Adam Przeworski, 2007). It is impossible for researchers to know a priori if interactions are omitted. Suzan Stokes (2014), using different terms, argues that the omnipresent possibility of omitting relevant interactions in the analysis is a source of an attitude of radical skepticism regarding the results of observational and experimental empirical investigation in the social sciences. She says:\n But from the standpoint of the radical skeptic, no research design can dispose of all potential interactions. Setting plausibility aside, if units have high dimensionality and if some confounders are unmeasurable, some unobserved trait is always likely to interact with the treatment. Faced with an experimental study that uncovers a causal effect, the radical skeptic should posit some unspecified subset of units whose response to treatment is at odds with the average response, potentially changing the theoretical implications of the study’s findings. If interactions can change the interpretation of experimental results, then the radical skeptic should be unnerved by their implication for experimental research. Because one can test only for interactions between treatments and observed factors, ungrounded skepticism implies that we will remain in the dark regarding the real findings of experimental studies. Unobserved interactions [...] are omnipresent and inevitably limit the contribution of research to knowledge (Stokes, 2014, pg. 46)  This project develops some machine learning approaches and semi-parametric Bayesian (SPB) methods for dealing with those issues and investigating if interactions were omitted.\nA recent a recent paper, \u0026ldquo;Modeling Context-Dependent Latent Effect Heterogeneity,\u0026rdquo; published in Political Analysis, I propose a hierarchical Dirichlet mixture of generalized linear models to deal with that problem. Using the model, researchers don’t need to specify all interactions explicitly. The model estimates marginal effects, even though interactions are missing in the model specification. Moreover, contrary to previous approaches, my method allows researchers to investigate whether contextual features such as schools, hospitals, neighborhoods, and country-specific institutional settings are associated with the emergence of latent heterogeneity in the effect of observables. I illustrate the model’s contributions with applications in political science that investigate attitudes toward financial aid and the effect of inequality on beliefs about meritocracy. The method is implemented in R, and it is available in the R package Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Generalized Linear Models (hdpGLM).\nI have used SPB models to study the latent structure of public support for welfare policies in OECD countries. I show that there is a hidden polarization among the observed socioeconomic groups in some countries but not others. My research indicates that one side effect of welfare policies in highly unequal societies with fragmented party systems is the existence of latent polarization in welfare policy preferences among individuals with similar observed socioeconomic characteristics. Countries that do not display such a latent polarization (the USA, Japan, Australia, New Zealand) usually have comparative smaller welfare states.\nHere are some related papers:\n  (2019) Modeling Context-Dependent Latent Effect Heterogeneity Political Analysis\n  Measuring Public Polarization and its Connection to the Determinants of Political Preferences\n  Identification Analysis and Multimodality of Posterior Distribution in Bayesian Models.\n  References   Przeworski, A., Is the science of comparative politics possible? , In C.

How do perceptions affect political attitudes and ideological positions?\nAs a part of this project, I have conducted a nation-wide survey experiment in 2018-2019 in Brazil with other collaborators to investigate the reaction of various groups to different types of information about the distribution of income and inequality. Preliminary results show that people, particularly from the middle class, tend to act as if demand for redistribution led to an increase in welfare state efforts. So, information about the distribution of income make people adjust their belief about the demand for redistribution and, as a consequence, strengthen their support (opposition) to redistributive policies and parties with redistributive programs.\nNot only that. Information about state-level demand for redistribution makes high-income groups more centralist (favor centralization of political authority). Poor population, on the other hand, support more decentralization when they receive the same information. An interesting finding is that the effect of information is stronger among the white population because this population perceive that they and, therefore, other groups as well, can influence political decisions. On the other hand, the attitudes of non-white population, who feel marginalized from the political process, are less affected by information about inequality and demand for welfare policies.\nSome related working papers:\n Public Policy Preferences, Redistribution, and Support for Welfare Integration in Multilevel Polities: a Survey Experiment in Brazil  ","date":1560306464,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560306464,"objectID":"d6cb23c32db0b2a8a7244327bd988a8c","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/research/survey-br/","publishdate":"2019-06-11T23:27:44-03:00","relpermalink":"/research/survey-br/","section":"research","summary":"Information, Income Distribution, and Policy Preferences Classical theories about public preferences for the allocation of political authority in multilevel polities emphasize the role of economic conditions, identity, and nationalist/regionalist values.

In the first paper, I propose a hdpGLM to deal with context-dependent latent heterogeneity in the effect of observed covariates. The model is motivated by the problem of investigating how people's socioeconomic characteristics affect their support for redistributive policies. The problem is that (1) many variables that condition the effect of observed socioeconomic characteristics of the individuals are latent or remain unmeasured, and (2) those latent conditioning features vary from country to country. The omitted variables can produce latent heterogeneity in the effect of observed covariates not only across countries but within each country as well. The proposed model allows us to investigate that context-dependent latent heterogeneity. It is general enough to be used with any hierarchical data in which the latent heterogeneity in the effect of lower-level characteristics is a function of upper-level features of the contexts, such as schools, hospitals, countries, or other institutional settings. The paper also shows how the model can be used to investigate the occurrence of Simpson's paradox in the context of generalized linear models. In the second paper, I apply the hdpGLM approach to investigate the latent heterogeneity and polarization in voters' redistributive policy preferences. Previous studies only investigated polarization among observed socioeconomic groups (rich versus poor, white versus non-white), overlooking or ignoring within-group latent polarizations and cross-groups latent coalitions in policy preferences. The major contribution of the paper is a polarization model that uses the hdpGLM approach, accounts for latent heterogeneity in the determinants of redistributive preferences, and demonstrates how that heterogeneity in the effect of observed covariates can lead to different latent structures of polarization in different political contexts. In the third and final paper, I dive into the theoretical question of the association between socioeconomic positions and welfare preferences, which is the topic that motivated the first two methodological papers. The theoretical question I address is: What emphexplains the negative association between socioeconomic positions and welfare policy preferences? That is, what is the mechanism that links socioeconomic positions to welfare policy preferences? The predominant explanation for that association is that people evaluate welfare policies from the point of view of their material self-interest. Looking at their own pocket, low-income groups see welfare policies as benefits for themselves, and high-income groups see that as cost and constraint to their consumption power. Based on political sociology and socially situated cognition literature, this paper questions that mechanism and argues that socioeconomic positions affect redistributive preferences in part because it affects perceptions about the socioeconomic environment and people's cognitive patterns of outcome attribution. Lower classes are more affected by the constraints imposed by external conditions, so they tend to attribute outcomes to exogenous forces rather than to individuals' agency, and they develop a more pessimistic perception about country's economy and unemployment. Those perceptions about the socioeconomic environment, affected by socioeconomic positions, affect redistribution preferences. The empirical analysis is based on a series of structural equations estimated using cross-national data from the European Social.","tags":null,"title":"Essays on the Micro-Foundations of Welfare Attitudes and Polarization of Policy Preferences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Ferrari","Kevin McAlister","Walter Mebane"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1532131200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1532131200,"objectID":"0525429d39782366872fddd63d5a28ba","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2018-dimensions/","publishdate":"2018-07-08T21:43:28.401139Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2018-dimensions/","section":"publication","summary":"We present new developments regarding positive empirical models of election frauds.

We consider the effect that introducing covariates to condition the means of turnout and of leading party vote share has on the performance and interpretability of the models. We assess the performance of the logistic model using simulated data in Monte Carlo sampling experiments. We apply both the Normal and logistic models to data from presidential elections in Brazil, the United States (California) and Kenya.

The new Brazilian Constitution augmented the distribution of public resources across states through intergovernmental transfers, mitigating state-level regional inequalities, but did not impose any loss of revenue to rich states. The interplay between the party structure, the electoral institutions, the Convention decision-making rules, and the regional inequalities explains that outcome. First, representatives from poor states with low fiscal capacity formed a coalition. They demanded more regional redistribution through constitutional transfers. Second, that coalition was favored by the majoritarian rule of the Constitutional Convention. Third, representatives in the Constitutional Convention were all members of national parties. At the same, time they voted in favor of the interest of their states, they defended the interest of their parties. Legislative representatives are elected at the state-level elections. If the members of the poor-states coalition had chosen a different fiscal design and this design had caused loss of revenue to the states of the rich-states minority coalition, such a decision could have caused electoral losses for some parties that have members at both poor- and rich-states coalitions. For this reason, they augmented the regional redistribution but did not impose any loss of revenue for rich states.","tags":null,"title":"Fiscal Decentralization and Redistribution of Public Revenue: FPE in the Brazilian Constitutional Convention of 1988","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Diogo Augusto Ferrari"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"f0da204f54c1a442c2455e1144b37a5f","permalink":"https://DiogoFerrari.github.io/publication/ferrari-2011-tratadosen/","publishdate":"2019-07-10T03:08:17.653652Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ferrari-2011-tratadosen/","section":"publication","summary":"Conventional wisdom among scholars and news media states that Congress is a minor player in the negotiation of international treaties because it lacks power and due to informational barriers.
